These are a few assorted scripts, terraform files and such to support an IRC network I administer. The client servers are
in Ohio, Dublin, and Sydney, with hubs in Virginia and California. The hubs are actually in private subnets with no
public IP at all which I've never seen another IRC network attempt. That does have the occasional drawback like needing
to wire up a NAT Gateway whenever you want to do updates.

These files aren't wired into any sort of CI/CD and are simply source control.
