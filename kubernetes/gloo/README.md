Here we use [Gloo Edge](https://www.solo.io/products/gloo-edge/) to be our edge proxy. It wraps Envoy with a lot of 
nice features, most of which I'm not using given the scale of this deployment.

The general logic for service delegation is that subdomains get their own Virtual Service, and paths off of the root 
domain just get delegated Route Tables. This is to keep things clean from an SSL certificate management perspective. In
your day-to-day in production this would probably be coupled with some sort of admission controller that only allows the
new Virtual Service if the domain matches what you permit.

This was the first piece installed in the K8s cluster so was done without the benefit of a CI/CD pipeline initially.
